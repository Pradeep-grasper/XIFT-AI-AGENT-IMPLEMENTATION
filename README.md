## **1. Architecture**

The application is built using a **modern, scalable architecture**:

### **Frontend**

* **Flutter Application**: Provides the user interface.

### **Backend Services**

* **Firebase Firestore**: Real-time, scalable NoSQL database for storing user data.
* **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user login and security.
* **Google Gemini Pro API**: Used for generating AI insights.

### **AI & Analytics Flow**

1. The user logs workouts and metrics through the **Flutter app**.
2. Data is saved to **Firebase Firestore**.
3. **AI insights** are dynamically generated by the **Gemini LLM**.
4. Users can access **logs and insights** from the appâ€™s dashboard.
